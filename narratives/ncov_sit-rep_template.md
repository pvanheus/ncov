# Executive summary

Here, we analyzed XX publicly shared COVID-19 genomes. By comparing these viral genomes to each other, we can characterize how COVID-19 is evolving and moving around the world.

For a current snapshot of the number of coronavirus cases around the world, see [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus).

In this report, we show XX
At this time, we urge XX

In this week's updates, we report:  

* XX

# [COVID-19 Resources](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-05)
We've prepared some resources that are worth reading to familiarize yourself with COVID-19 and the virus that causes it, SARS-CoV-2.
This information will make interpreting the data we present in this narrative easier; if you aren't familiar with phylogenetic trees, we encourage you to check out the ['How to Read Phylogenies' narrative](https://nextstrain.org/narratives/trees-background/) and come back when you're ready.

## Nextstrain narratives

The following pages contain analysis performed using [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org).
Scrolling through will reveal paragraphs of text with a corresponding visualization of the genomic data.

To have full genomes of a novel and large RNA virus this quickly is a remarkable achievement.
These analyses have been made possible by the rapid and open sharing of genomic data and interpretations by scientists all around the world (see the final slide for a visualization of sequencing authorship).

# [About this data](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-XX-XX?c=country&r=country&d=map&p=grid&legend=closed)
We currently have sequences from samples taken in XX countries across X continents. This is an incredible feat -- sequencing an unknown, large RNA virus in the midst of a pandemic is difficult, and is only possible through the incredible work and timely sharing of data by scientists and physicians around the world.
<br><br>
While this data enables us to infer many useful characteristics of the outbreak and track its spread in real time, it's important to emphasize that our conclusions are limited by the available data.
<br><br>
For example, the map shows very few sequences from the global south. This is NOT because COVID-19 isn't circulating in these areas, or that these cases are not as crucial to understand; rather, we just don't have much data available from these areas. The size of each circle on the map indicates how much data is currently available from that area, rather than the true size of the outbreak.

We would like to acknowledge the amazing and timely work done by all scientists involved in this outbreak, and particularly those working in China.
Only through the rapid sharing of genomic data and metadata are analyses such as these possible.
